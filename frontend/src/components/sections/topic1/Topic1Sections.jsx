              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">üß† The Logic Behind the Machine</h3>
              <p>
                Digital computers work using electrical signals that represent two states:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li><strong>ON (1)</strong> ‚Äì electricity is flowing</li>
                <li><strong>OFF (0)</strong> ‚Äì no electricity is flowing</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These two states form the binary language of computers. Boolean Algebra provides a systematic method to manipulate these binary values using operations like:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li><code>AND (¬∑)</code></li>
                <li><code>OR (+)</code></li>
                <li><code>NOT (‚Äæ)</code></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each operation models a type of logic that can be physically built into electronic circuits. Logic gates ‚Äî the building blocks of processors ‚Äî are direct hardware implementations of Boolean logic.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">üîå Example in Hardware</h3>
              <p>
                Consider this:
              </p>
              <p>
                You flip a light switch. That action translates into an electrical signal.
              </p>
              <p>
                The signal might pass through an <strong>AND gate</strong>, which checks if two conditions are met (e.g., the light is on <em>only</em> when the switch is up <em>and</em> the door is closed).
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the output, the light turns on (<strong>1</strong>) or stays off (<strong>0</strong>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Multiply that logic by billions, and you get how CPUs perform everything from calculations to decision-making.

            <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 rounded-md shadow-sm">
              <p className="font-semibold text-yellow-700 mb-2">‚úÖ Happiness and Treats</p>
              <p>
              Imagine you‚Äôre asked, <i>‚ÄúWhat makes you happy?‚Äù</i> You might say, <i>‚ÄúPizza or ice cream.‚Äù</i>
              <br />
              In Boolean logic, this situation can be described using the <strong>OR</strong> operation. It means you don‚Äôt need both to be happy ‚Äî just one is enough.
            </p>
            </div>

            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 mt-4">
                  Let <strong>P = 1</strong> if you eat pizza.
                  <br />
                  Let <strong>I = 1</strong> if you eat ice cream.
                  <br />
                  Then: <strong>Happiness = P OR I</strong>
                  <br />
                  If you have either treat, your happiness is "true" ‚Äî you‚Äôre smiling. This mirrors how the <strong>OR</strong> gate in digital logic works: if at least one input is "on," the output is also "on."
                </p>
            

            <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 rounded-md shadow-sm">

              <p>
              Now think about a fan. It doesn‚Äôt run just because it's plugged in ‚Äî you also have to press the switch.
              <br />
              This is a classic case for the <strong>AND</strong> operation: both conditions must be met.
            </p>
            </div>


            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 mt-4">
                    Let <strong>P = 1</strong> if power is on.
                    <br />
                    Let <strong>S = 1</strong> if the switch is pressed.
                    <br />
                    Then: <strong>Fan = P AND S</strong>
                    <br />
                    If even one of these is missing ‚Äî the fan won‚Äôt turn on. That‚Äôs the nature of the <strong>AND</strong> logic: it needs <strong>everything</strong> to be true before it activates.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-600 mb-3 ">üß† Why These Examples Matter</h2>
            <p className="text-base text-gray-700">
              These examples aren‚Äôt just cute analogies ‚Äî they mirror exactly how computers, electronics, and digital circuits make decisions.
              <br />
              Boolean Algebra gives us the <strong>language</strong> to describe these decisions. From checking if a password is correct, to determining whether a machine should turn on, it's all built on combinations of <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, and <strong>NOT</strong> operations.
