          Boolean Algebra is a mathematical structure used to analyze and simplify logical statements. 
          It serves as the foundation of digital electronics and computer science, 
          forming the basis for binary operations in everything from simple electronic devices like calculators to highly advanced technologies such as supercomputers, artificial intelligence, and data encryption.
            <br /><br />
          But before we dive into how it works, it's important to know <b>where it all began </b>.

      title: "The Origin of Boolean Algebra",

        <p>
          Boolean Algebra was invented by <strong>George Boole</strong>, a British mathematician and logician, in the mid-1800s. 
          His goal was to find a way to express human reasoning using mathematical symbols. 
          In 1854, he published a book titled <em>An Investigation of the Laws of Thought</em>, 
          where he outlined a new system of logic based entirely on binary values: <strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong>.
            <br /><br />
            At the time, his work was viewed as abstract and philosophical, but decades later, his system turned out to be perfect for designing electronic circuits.
             As electrical engineers began building computers in the 20th century, they needed a system that
              could operate using only two voltage levels: ON and OFF. Boolean Algebra fit the bill exactly.

            At its core, Boolean Algebra works with binary values ‚Äî specifically, <strong>1</strong> and <strong>0</strong>.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
            <li><strong>1</strong> represents: True, Yes, or High voltage</li>
            <li><strong>0</strong> represents: False, No, or Low voltage</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Unlike traditional algebra (which deals with numbers), Boolean Algebra focuses on logical values (true or false only).
          </p>
          <p>
          This kind of system is useful in all digital devices, where operations depend on whether a signal is present (1) or absent (0), whether a switch is on (1) or off (0), or whether a condition is true (1) or false (0).

              <strong>Boolean variables</strong> are fundamental units in logic systems, typically represented by letters like <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>X</code>, or <code>Y</code>. These variables can take on only two possible values:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li><strong>1</strong>: representing <strong>true</strong>, <strong>yes</strong>, or <strong>ON</strong></li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              Using Boolean variables, we can construct <strong>Boolean expressions</strong>‚Äîcombinations of variables and logical operations such as <code>AND (¬∑)</code>, <code>OR (+)</code>, and <code>NOT (‚Äæ)</code>. These expressions are the language used to describe how digital systems behave based on different input conditions.

              <p>
                Digital computers work using electrical signals that represent two states:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li><strong>ON (1)</strong> ‚Äì electricity is flowing</li>
                <li><strong>OFF (0)</strong> ‚Äì no electricity is flowing</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These two states form the binary language of computers. Boolean Algebra provides a systematic method to manipulate these binary values using operations like:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li><code>AND (¬∑)</code></li>
                <li><code>OR (+)</code></li>
                <li><code>NOT (‚Äæ)</code></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each operation models a type of logic that can be physically built into electronic circuits. Logic gates ‚Äî the building blocks of processors ‚Äî are direct hardware implementations of Boolean logic.

              </p>
              <p>
                You flip a light switch. That action translates into an electrical signal.
              </p>
              <p>
                The signal might pass through an <strong>AND gate</strong>, which checks if two conditions are met (e.g., the light is on <em>only</em> when the switch is up <em>and</em> the door is closed).
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the output, the light turns on (<strong>1</strong>) or stays off (<strong>0</strong>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Multiply that logic by billions, and you get how CPUs perform everything from calculations to decision-making.
